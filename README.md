# Void.js
This is a Javascript repository that I use to practice JS programming skill and Algorithm implementation.

Well, this is where I write Javascript code that implement many popular algorithm in Computer Science. I think this is a good way to help me to enhance my Javascript skill and also computer algorithm in Computer Science. Because I love to learn algorithms very much, and I need to choose a language to implement them. Javascript is a fun and awesome programming language (for me), so I choose JS though I have better skill on C++. And Void.js was born, the name "Void" doesn't have dense meaning, it just came over my head with a mystery and unknown thought. So, I will try to implement as many algorithms as I can in JS code, and I won't forget to comment in every algorithm I'm writing, to make sure that it's clear for people to read and understand. Maybe when finished, it can be a helpful thing for me and other to use (I hope so, though the chance is very very low :) ). P/s: This was to be a private repository but because of low budget and lack of transmission method so I had to set this to public :).
